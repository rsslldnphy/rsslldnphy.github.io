Beyond fringe groups  
artists wait  
consider distance  
shake, scatter drops  
in patterns  
look for questions  
leaving markers like rocks  
twigs  
made of coloured sand  
and with their white sticks  
plough furrows  
like some buddhist gravel garden  
rainbow.  
Kick the sand!  
Grains fly like mice  
and dance like mice might.  
Twisted fractal arms  
spiral in  
swing, collide  
and scatter drops  
in patterns.
