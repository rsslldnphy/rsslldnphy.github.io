Fat grown-ups who can't ride, sit  
beneath a statue of a small boy who smelt of mist.  
Thinking only of his pleasure before his own;  
hatching plans, warm caresses, music and her tongue.  
He would not accept it. The Bull showed no such fears.  
But sweat, exhaustion pricks his shining face  
and seizes on his lips.
