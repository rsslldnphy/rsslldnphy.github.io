she wondered then, one thick calf complete  
if worrying affected her performance.  
crouched in the darkness  

the man and the woman, approached  
drag their domed surfaces  
with a gesture the body must contract.  

the carpet on the floor is red, I nod  
pause, before correcting  
it was still going on.  

the glass door swings open  
a breeze, sealed with wax, flaunts the clear air  
uses euphemisms to communicate this bleakness  

driven by righteous anger.  
one thick calf complete  
this is much more than we should have learned.  

the man and the woman in drag, pause.  
domed surfaces contract, bound in black linen  
I lay my head on his hard, flat pillow.  

a breeze, sealed with wax, responds  
the carpet is red  
it was still going on
