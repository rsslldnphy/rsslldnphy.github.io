If my cat had wings, and  
paws that could open door handles -  
I would send her to do the shopping  
while I was at work.  
She would buy more than just cat food.  
And she would learn voodoo  
but not misuse it.  

Yes, if my cat had wings  
things would be good for us.  
We would eat out every night  
unless we wanted to cook.  

And if my cat had wings -   
if my cat had wings  
like the birds  
and the bees  
(and Always Ultra)  
she would never get pregnant.  
She would be too busy flying.  

But if she did get pregnant -   
if my cat did get pregnant  
she would give birth to the clothes-pegs I need  
to hang out my left-over washing.  
She would give birth to  
a box of matches  
a length of string  
a fork  
something I lost four years ago  
and some kittens.  

Roughly half of which  
would have wings.
